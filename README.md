# Aegis

**Phonetic:** /ˈiː.dʒɪs/ (EE-jis)

Aegis is a Debian Stable-based Linux distro for seniors: zero-config by default, automatic security updates, low-disruption UX, and reliable performance on older low-tier laptops.

## Why Aegis

Most desktop Linux systems still expect manual setup and troubleshooting.  
Aegis is designed as an appliance-like OS: predictable, safe, and easy to use every day.

## Core Principles

1. Zero terminal required for normal use
2. Security by default
3. Stability over novelty
4. Low-disruption updates
5. Works on older hardware

## Target Users

- Seniors and older adults
- Non-technical users
- Families supporting relatives remotely
- People migrating from aging Windows laptops

## v1 Scope

- Simple launcher-based desktop (XFCE/LXQt base)
- DE + EN language baseline
- Automatic security updates
- Btrfs snapshot rollback strategy
